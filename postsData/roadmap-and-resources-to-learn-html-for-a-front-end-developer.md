# Road map and Resources to learn HTML for a Front-end developer
**Are you a beginner and looking for resources and topics to master HTML?** Here is that **masterpiece** that will give you both important topics and resources to learn HTML.

Hi everyone! as you know I am a Frontend Developer. That's why I got a lot of queries like How I can become a developer? What topics I should learn? Suggest me a roadmap for me! and many more like the above. So, I have decided to write a blog post on it so that everyone can get benefit from it. And this is the first post of this initiative and in this blog post, I will share the resources and topics to master HTML.

First of all, let me introduce myself.

Currently, I am working with a **Dubai, UAE-based startup Strabl** as a **frontend developer** on an e-commerce platform.

Here is the list of topics that you have to learn to get started and also for most projects. But first, let me clarify that HTML has many topics but in beginning, you do not have to learn all of those. Following is the list of common topics that are enough in beginning:


- Headings and Paragraph
- Links
- Lists
- Tables
- Images
- Div and Sections
- Forms and Inputs
- Meta Tags
